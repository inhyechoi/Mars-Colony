Web-based application project using Angular 2

## Technologies
* Angular2
* HTML5
* CSS3 (flexbox layout)
* SCSS 
* Postman
* APIs
* TypeScript
* Webpack

## What I have learned

Use GET and POST HTTP request using Angular 2 with internal API in order to 
* Components and modules for page construction.
* Routing and navigation to connect components and navigate between them.
* The use of Angular 2 directives such as ngFor, ngIf, ngClass, and ngModel for binding of views to models and manipulation and presentation of data.
** save the information on both new colonist and new alien encounter.
** get the list of the recent alien encounters from Postman.
* Classes, Interfaces and decorators for form and api representation and component definition.

There was a strong component of API generation with this project and my knowledge of the creation of GET and POST requests expanded greatly.
Use the local storage to save new colonist object.
