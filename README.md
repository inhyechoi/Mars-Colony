Web-based application project using Angular 2

## Technologies
* Angular2
* HTML5
* CSS3 (flexbox layout)
* SCSS 
* Postman


## What I have learned

Use GET and POST HTTP request using Angular 2 with internal API in order to 
* save the information on both new colonist and new alien encounter.
* get the list of the recent alien encounters from Postman.
* create a new encounter report.

Use router to navigate through different pages.
Use the local storage to save new colonist object.
