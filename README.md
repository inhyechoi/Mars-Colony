Web-based application project using Angular 2

## Technologies
* Angular2
* HTML5
* CSS3 transitions and Flexbox layout
* SCSS 
* Postman


## What I have learned

* Use Get and Post HTTP request using Angular's HTTP service in order to 
* 1. save the information on both new Colonist and new Alien encounter
* 2. get the list of the recent alien encounters from Postman
* 3. create a new Encounter report 

* Use router to navigate through different pages
* Use the local storage to save the new Colonist object
